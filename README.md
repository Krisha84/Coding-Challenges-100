# üöÄ Coding-Challenges-100 - Java | C | Python

This is my personal repository where I‚Äôm solving **100+ different coding problems** in **Java, C, and Python**.

I‚Äôm not sticking to one language ‚Äî I‚Äôm practicing and experimenting with **multiple languages for the same problems** to strengthen my coding skills and logic building.

## ‚ú® About

- üîç I'm exploring **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Logical Problems**.
- üîÑ Most problems are solved in **3 languages**:
  - ![Java](https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/java-coffee-cup-logo.png) **Java**
  - ![C](https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/c-programming.png) **C**
  - ![Python](https://img.icons8.com/color/24/000000/python.png) **Python**

- ‚úÖ This is an **ongoing project**, so not all 100 problems are completed yet.  
Stay tuned as I keep adding more solutions.
